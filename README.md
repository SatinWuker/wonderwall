# Wonderwall
Wonderwall is a general purpose and functional programming language without parenthese

# Run
**All of the avaliable code is in the [src](/src) folder**

Run in g++
<br>
`wwg` or `g++ main.cpp -Ofast`

Run in clang++
<br>
`wwcl` or `clang++ main.cpp -Oz`

However, clang and g++ are somehow incompatible and the code is only able to run efficiently on g++
