# Wonderwall
Wonderwall is a general purpose and functional programming language without parenthese

# Run
**All of the avaliable code is in the [src](/src) folder**

## G++
<br>
`wwg` or `g++ main.cpp -Ofast`

## Clang++
### Windows
<br>
`wwcl` or `clang++ -Oz main.cpp -o wonderwall.out`
### Linux
`./run.sh`

However, clang and g++ are somehow incompatible and the code is only able to run efficiently on g++
